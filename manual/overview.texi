The @command{serve} utility is a generic server, meaning that it can act like a
network server for almost any purpose.  It does so thanks to the highly
flexible POSIX file descriptors.

For example, you can turn the @command{cat} command into a ``parrot server'' by
simply running the following command.

@example
serve -a "inet 0.0.0.0 12345" cat
@end example

It will then open an IPv4 server on port 12345 that mirrors all incoming bytes
back to their sender.

Instead of just a command like @command{cat}, you can pass an entire POSIX
shell prompt which may include setting environment variables, running an entire
shell script rather than one utility and passing it arguments, though you will
need to use quote marks since that introduces spaces.

@example
serve -a "inet 0.0.0.0 12345" "ANSWER=42 ./session.sh -f config.ini"
@end example

The main benefit of @command{serve} is that it is trivial to deploy it with
applications that were tested with a basic standard input/output interface.
