The @command{serve} utility sets its global locale with the following C
function call.

@example
setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
@end example

As a result, some aspects of its behavior may be influenced by the following
environment variables, especially @var{LC_NUMERIC} and @var{LC_MESSAGES}:

@itemize
@item @var{LC_CTYPE};
@item @var{LC_COLLATE};
@item @var{LC_MONETARY};
@item @var{LC_NUMERIC};
@item @var{LC_TIME};
@item @var{LC_MESSAGES}.
@end itemize

This change of locale does not affect child processes that @command{serve}
creates.
