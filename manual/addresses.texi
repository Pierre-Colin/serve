In order to open a server, you must specify a listening address implementing
the network layer from the OSI model.  The @command{serve} utility allows you
to do that by passing the @code{-a} option.

The operand to the @code{-a} option is a string specifying the listening
address.  It is made of space-separated ASCII tokens.  The first one specifies
the address family and is case sensitive.  If no @code{-a} option is present,
@code{serve} behaves as if @code{-a "inet 0.0.0.0 4869"} had been passed.

@item
The family @code{inet} corresponds to POSIX value @code{AF_INET} and specifies
an IPv4 address.  The remainder of the operand must be two tokens specifying
respectively the IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation and the port number in
decimal notation.  The address is parsed by using the @code{inet_addr} function
as defined by POSIX.  The port number must be non-negative and less than 65536.

Specifying a machine's IP address means you will only accept incoming
connections from that machine.  The special IP address @code{127.0.0.1} allows
you to only accept connections from the same computer the server is running on.
@item
Specifying a network's IP address means you will accept incoming connections
from any machine in that network.  The IP address @code{0.0.0.0} allows you to
accept connections from any machine on the Internet.

@item
The family @code{inet6} corresponds to POSIX value @code{AF_INET6} and
specifies an IPv6 address.  The remainder of the operand must be two tokens
specifying respectively the IPv6 address in standard form and the port number
in decimal notation.  The address is parsed by using the @code{inet_pton}
function as defined by POSIX.  The port number must be non-negative and less
than 65536.

Specifying a machine's IP address means you will only accept incoming
connections from that machine.  The special IP address @code{::1} allows you to
only accept connections from the same computer the server is running on.
@item
Specifying a network's IP address means you will accept incoming connections
from any machine in that network.  The IP address @code{::} allows you to
accept connections from any machine on the Internet.

@item
The family @code{unix} corresponds to POSIX value @code{AF_UNIX} and specifies
a Unix-domain socket.  The remainder of the operand must be the path to the
socket file.  The maximum length of such a path is OS-specified.

@item
The family @code{vsock} is supported only on Linux.  It corresponds to Linux
value @code{AF_VSOCK} and specifies a VSOCK address.  The remainder of the
operand must be two non-negative integers in decimal notation specifying the
port number and the context identifier respectively.

@item
The family @code{x25} is supported only on Linux.  It corresponds to Linux
value @code{AF_X25} and specifies an X.25 address.  The remainder of the
operand must be a sequence of at most 15 digits and specify the address itself.
